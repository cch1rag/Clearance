# Contributing to Clearance

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Here is what you need to know before opening a PR.

---

## Before You Open a PR

Open an issue first for anything beyond a straightforward bug fix. This lets us agree on scope and approach before you spend time writing code.

---

## What Is In Scope

- Bug fixes
- New `kTCCService` columns in the permission table
- Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver, keyboard navigation)
- Performance improvements to table rendering or DB loading
- Theme refinements (contrast, spacing, typography)

## What Is Out of Scope

- SIP bypass or writing to system TCC (`/var/db/TCC`)
- App Store distribution
- Windows or Linux ports
- Third-party Swift dependencies

---

## Setup

Requirements: macOS 12 or later, Xcode 15 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cch1rag/Clearance.git
cd Clearance
open Clearance.xcodeproj
```

Press **⌘R** to build and run. There are no external runtime dependencies to install.

If you change `project.yml`, regenerate the Xcode project before committing:

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Do not commit Xcode user-specific state such as `xcuserdata/` or `*.xcuserstate`. Keep the shared `Clearance` scheme tracked so contributors can build the project consistently from Xcode or `xcodebuild`.

Install XcodeGen only if you need to regenerate the project:

```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

## Debugging the WebView

Open Safari, go to **Develop → [Your Mac] → Clearance**, and you will get a full Web Inspector attached to the WKWebView.

---

## Code Style

- Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- The HTML app lives in a single file (`Clearance/Resources/tcc_audit_app.html`) and must stay that way
- Comment non-obvious SQL queries and WKWebView delegate logic; skip obvious comments

## History Hygiene

- Prefer one logical change per PR and squash fixup or review-nit commits before merge
- Combine docs-only nits into the parent change instead of stacking tiny follow-up commits
- This repository prefers squash merges for most PRs so the public history stays short and linear
- Do not merge a branch that has no net diff from `main`
- `project.yml` is the source of truth for project structure and build settings
- If `project.yml` changes, regenerate `Clearance.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` in the same PR
- Keep unrelated generated project churn out of feature or docs PRs

---

## PR Format

- Title: `type: short description` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `style`)
- One logical change per PR
- Include a screenshot for any UI change
- Plain English in the description — what changed and why

### PR Checklist

- [ ] I squashed fixups and review nits before merge
- [ ] Any `project.yml` change is paired with the matching `Clearance.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` regeneration
- [ ] Generated Xcode project churn is intentional and relevant to this PR
- [ ] User-facing privacy, install, or security wording is updated if behavior changed
